about: >-
  Raven Michelle Diaz Raven was raised in a very artistic and musical home, and
  from an early age developed a love for the creative process.

  She sat next to her Grandfather who was a talented painter and absorbed much
  of his artistic process. During her adolescence she took several art classes
  and begin to self-teach many skills.

  She graduated in 2006 with a BA in Int. Relations and Spanish, and a minor in art.  Although all of the various artistic instruction was helpful, she identifies mostly as self-taught, taking inspiration primarily from Nature and the living mythology of existence.

  Her Peruvian Mural series is on permanent display in Cajamarca, Peru. She also has murals displayed in California, Oregon, and Hawaii.  Raven utilizes various mediums for her creations and canvasses, including acrylics, watercolors,oils, fire, wood, gourds, and found natural objects.  She prefers to use round or circular canvases as as they are evocative of the feminine form.
