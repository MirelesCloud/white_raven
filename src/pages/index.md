    Raven was raised in a very artistic and musical home, and from an early age
    developed a love for the creative process.

    She sat next to her Grandfather who was a talented painter and absorbed much
    of his artistic process. During her adolescence she took several art classes
    and begin to self-teach many skills.

    She graduated in 2006 with a BA in Int. Relations and Spanish, and a minor
    in art.  Although all of the various artistic instruction was helpful, she
    identifies mostly as self-taught, taking inspiration primarily from Nature
    and the living mythology of existence.

    Her Peruvian Mural series is on permanent display in Cajamarca, Peru. She
    also has murals displayed in California, Oregon, and Hawaii.  Raven utilizes
    various mediums for her creations and canvasses, including acrylics,
    watercolors,oils, fire, wood, gourds, and found natural objects.  She
    prefers to use round or circular canvases as as they are evocative of the
    feminine form.
